# code-quiz

## Description
    This application is a code quiz that can save, display, and fetch a highscore from local storage. Upon starting the quiz, if a question is answered incorrectly time will be subtracted from the available time, if a question is answered correctly the user will add 20 points to their score.

## Usage
    To take the quiz a user must click the "Start" button at the bottom of the page and answer all questions in the alloted time. Upon completion the user will be prompted for their initials and after they are entered the highscore will display reflecting their score and inputted initials. If the user desires to only view the highscore they can press the "view highscore" button at the top of the page, but the page will need to be reloaded to get back to the quiz.
